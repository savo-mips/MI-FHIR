# MI-FHIR
a simple, patient-centered webapp designed for pregnant women with low health literacy. The app pulls clinical notes and health data from EHRs using FHIR, then translates complex medical language into easy-to-understand summaries. Users can view their most important metrics online in on a secure website. By combining FHIR interoperability with inclusive design, this tool empowers patients to better understand and engage with their maternal care.
